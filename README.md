## Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trial Data (Sem'Eval 2023 Task)

### Description
Developed a natural language inference model for clinical trial data, specifically for breast cancer Clinical Trial Reports from the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The goal was to determine the relation between CTRs and hypothesis statements using BERT and deBERTa models, assigning weights to essential evidence and cleaning and truncating the data for feature extraction. The model achieved a validation F1-score of 0.60 and a test F1-score of 0.52.
